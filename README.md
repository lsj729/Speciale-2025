GEModelTools https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/GEModelTools/tree/master is needed to run the files in the repo. The file GEModelClass.py found in the link has been modified and is included in the uploaded files in the repository.

In the HANK folder there is a folder for the corresponidng HANK with both Firm equity and Government bonds active at the same time. To run the whole used HANK model, this model needs to be run firstly, as it produces a file "other_notebook_bundle.pkl", which needs to be copied into the HANK folder.
